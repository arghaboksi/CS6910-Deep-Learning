# CS6910-Deep-Learning

## Assignment-1

###### In this assignment we implemented a feedforward neural network and wrote the backpropagation code for training the network. We implemented all the necessary functions from scratch using numpy. The network was trained and tested using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Given an input image from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the network classifies the image into 1 of the possible 10 classes.

#### Instructions for training and evaluating the model

###### All the relevant functions, wandb settings and configurattions are present within the notebook. Running the code cells one after another will perform the tasks asked in the assignment. If one wishes to change the hyperparameter settings then he/she needs to update the "sweep_config" object. All the wandb log statements are already present in the code. In order to change the number of times wandb agent runs one needs to change the count parameter in wandb.agent('',train,count=20).
